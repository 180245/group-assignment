	 <div class="test col-md-4"> 
	  <h3>Anja de Vries </h3>
	 My youngest daughter recommended this app to me and I am very happy that she did. The first time I tried it, I completely saw it's value. My personal favorite feature is the advice column, just reading other people's experiences and expert advice on topics of stress prevention and stress relief is very useful to me.

	  <h3>Susan Vermeer </h3>
	 At first I was a bit sceptical about the app and the concept. However, after a couple of days I couldn't live without it. The relaxing sounds make me feel very calm, the podcast really helped me understanding the true meaning of meditation and the advice column is very active and helpful to read.

	  <h3>Peter Jansen </h3>
	 This product really is insanely good. I have tried multiple other ways to relax till this point but this is the only one that really worked for me. The amount of times this app has helped me to relax is unbelievable. I could recommend this app to anyone who struggles with stress in their daily lives.
